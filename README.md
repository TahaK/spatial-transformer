# Spatial Transformer Networks

This project contains a tensorflow implementation developed to get a better understanding of the bahaviour of Spatial Transformer Networks under different training conditions. It examines the training under dataset size restrictions, different noise models, learning rates, batch sizes, embedding losses and different architecture choises like pooling vs dilated convolutions.
